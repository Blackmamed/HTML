<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>

<p>Dear Eileen,</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

Starting dates: 1 Sep 2020, 1 Oct 2020<br>

<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
  <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
  <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

<p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>
